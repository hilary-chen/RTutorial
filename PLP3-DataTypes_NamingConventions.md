#R
#DATA TYPES
R does not require that data types are declare, as they will still be able to create the variables that store the follow data types of information. Examples of how some are represented are listed below:

* <b>int</b>

* <b>string</b>

* <b>floating-point number</b>

* <b>boolean</b>

* <b>array/list</b>

* <b>hash/dictionary</b>

Even though it is not needed in R to specify the data type immediately, there is a built-in function within R to see which data type a variable is; there is also another built-in function that is able to change a variable to another data type.
