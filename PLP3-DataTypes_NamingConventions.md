#R
#DATA TYPES
R does not require that data types are declare, as they will still be able to create the variables that store the follow data types of information. Examples of how some are represented are listed below:

* <b>int</b>

* <b>string</b>

* <b>floating-point number</b>

* <b>boolean</b>

* <b>array/list</b>

* <b>hash/dictionary</b>

Even though it is not needed in R to specify the data type immediately, there is a built-in function within R to see which data type a variable is.

#CONVERTING BETWEEN DATA TYPES
In R, it is also possible to change a variable into a different type with a built-in function.
```

* <b>What happens if you add an int and float together?</b> 
* <b>Can different data types be put into the same array or list?</b>

#NAMING CONVENTIONS
In R, the naming conventions are not too limited, compared to other programming languages.
