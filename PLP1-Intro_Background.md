#R

R is described, by the [R-Project](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f), as:
>"a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files"

In brief, R is a software enviornment (that is free) and programming language that is used primarily for statistical purposes, such as for computing or graphic presentation. It is a interpreted, functional language, where problems are modeled after using a series of mathematical functions. There are other virtual machines that are offered to the public for free from different developers, such as RStudio.

There are currently two development versions of R:
  1. *r-patched* - This is a patched version of R 3.2.3 (the most current version) that is most often used to fix bugs. 
  2. *r-devel* - This is a developmental version that is used to implement changes to R that may be later released. 

#HISTORY
The beginnings of its development began at the University of Auckland, in 1992. R was originally developed as a way to teach intro-level statistics at the University--initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka. R gets a lot of its "inspiration" and derivation from Lisp, S (for its syntax), and Scheme (for its semantics). 

By 1994, a introductory version was completed and was released free to a select email list of people. Finally, after years of responding to bug reports and comments, in 2000, it was realeased to the public as a free software project. 

#USAGE
As mentioned earlier, R is used for statistical purposes and also data representation. R is also further used for conducting statistical analysis, creating software for those purposes, or used in web applications. It is used quite largely by data miners or those in the statistics field. Scripts can be written using R to do smaller tasks that may be implemented in larger programs.

The most popular Github projects, using R, are:
  1. a system of plotting for R (using the basis of graphics) https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2
  2. a package that can be used in RStudio that aids to create web applications in R https://github.com/rstudio/shiny
  3. a platform to learn and teach R https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses

#RESOURCES
The resources that I will use for this semester will be from two introductory R textbooks:
  1. *R for Dummies (2nd ed.)*
  2. *Beginning R: An Introduction to Statistical Programming (2nd ed.)*

I will also be using the [R-Project website](https://www.r-project.org/) for more insight on how R can be used. 

Additionally, online resources can be helpful. StackOverFlow.com may be a useful resource if I am having trouble; however, I understand that certain answers provided on StackOverFlow are not 100% accurate. Also, there is a website that teaches you the basics of R, which may be the first place I look into: [CodeSchool](http://tryr.codeschool.com/).
