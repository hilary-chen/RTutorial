#R

R is described, by the [R-Project](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f), as:
>"a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files"

In brief, R is a software enviornment (that is free) and programming language that is used primarily for statistical purposes, such as for computing or graphic presentation. it is a interpreted, functional language, where problems are modeled after using a series of mathematical functions.

There are currently two development versions of R:
  (1) **r-patched** - This is a patched version of the R 3.2.3 (the most current version) that is most often used to fix bugs. 
  (2) **r-devel** - This is a developmental version that is used to implement changes to R that may be later released.
