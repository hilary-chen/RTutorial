#R

R is described, by the [R-Project](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html#What-is-R_003f), as:
>"a system for statistical computation and graphics. It consists of a language plus a run-time environment with graphics, a debugger, access to certain system functions, and the ability to run programs stored in script files"

In brief, R is a software enviornment (that is free) and programming language that is used primarily for statistical purposes, such as for computing or graphic presentation. it is a interpreted, functional language, where problems are modeled after using a series of mathematical functions. There are virtual machines that are offered to the public for free, such as RStudio.

There are currently two development versions of R:
  1. *r-patched* - This is a patched version of the R 3.2.3 (the most current version) that is most often used to fix bugs. 
  2. *r-devel* - This is a developmental version that is used to implement changes to R that may be later released. 

#HISTORY
The beginnings of its development began at the University of Auckland, in 1992. R was originally developed as a way to teach intro-level statistics at the University--initiated by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka. R gets a lot of its "inspiration" and derivation from S (syntax) and Scheme (semantics). 

By 1994, a introductory version is completed and is released free to the a select list of people. Finally, after years of responding to bug reports and comments, in 2000, it was realeased to the public as a free software project.
