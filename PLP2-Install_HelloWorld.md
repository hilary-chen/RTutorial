#R
The most current version of R is 3.2.3. 

#INSTALLATION
R is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux; however, tnstallation of R may differ depending on the Operating System of the computer you are using. On the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org/), you are able to download the binary files needed, depending on the Operating System. More detailed instructions are included on the website provided.

**To Check If It's Already Installed**

* Windows - Go to the 'Start' Menu and click on 'All Programs' or 'All Apps' (depending on which version of Windows you are using.) While scrolling through the list, if you can see 'R,' it is already installed onto your Windows machine/

* Linux - Open the terminal of your machine and type $ R--version.

* Mac - I am having trouble finding how to check if it is already installed; however, since this is a working document, it will be updated when more research has been done.

**Front-End**

RStudio is also a good front-end enviornment to use to program with R. You can download RStudio for free from their [website](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/). If you would like additional features added on, that will be an additional price; however, for the purpose of this project, the default features are adequate.
