#R

The use of functions will improve the functionality of R programs immensely, but it is also important to understand the concepts of scope and paramters within R when creating these functions.

#SYNTAX OF DECLARING FUNCTIONS
The syntax for declaring functions in R is very similar to other popular programming languages. The syntax in R requires that a function be named, then is followed by <i><-</i>, the keyword <i>function</i>, a set of parathenses (), a starting curly brace {, the statements/actions that you want the function to do, then an ending curly brace }. An example of a function declaration is provided:
```R
add5<-function(a){
  a=a+5
  return(a)
}
```
